## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r code1, echo=FALSE}
s1720 <-
ggplot (s, aes (x = as.Date (Date)), y = Rating))
geom_vline
xintercept = as.numeric as.Date ("2020 01 20")),
colour = "indianred1", linetype = "
geom_smooth
(method = "loess", size = 1.5, colour =
lightseagreen ", fill = lightseagreen ")
geom_point
(alpha = 0.2, colour = lightseagreen
labs(x = "Date", y = "Average daily rating (1
5)", title =
"Top 3 scented candles Amazon reviews 2017 2020")+
theme_light
theme(
plot.title = element_text (size=
scale_x_date
date_labels = "%m --%Y", date_breaks = "6
month")
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

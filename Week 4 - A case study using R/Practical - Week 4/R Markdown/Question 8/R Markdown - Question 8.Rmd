## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r cars1, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
s <- ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist))+geom_point(colour="blue")+theme_light()+labs(x = "Speed", y = "Distance")+ggtitle("Distance vs Speed - Scatter Plot")+theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+geom_smooth (method = "loess", size = 1.5, colour =
"lightseagreen ", fill = "lightseagreen")
s
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
